#,AgricultureSubsidies,농업 보조금,"전략적 이유로 일부 정부들은 국가의 안정적인 식량 공급을 보장하기 위해 농민들에게 보조금을 지불하는 것을 기쁘게 생각한다. 이것은 자유 시장을 역행하고 매우 비쌀 수 있지만 그것은 농업 사회의 일자리와 투표를 보호한다."
#,AirlineTax,항공연료세,항공 연료는 일반적으로 과세 대상이 아니다. 항공연료세를 지지하는 사람들은 이 세금이 환경파괴적인 운송에 대한 불공평헌 보조금이 된다고 주장한다. 항공사들은 항공 연료에 세금을 부과하는 것은 그들이 국외에서 연료를 급유하도록 부추겨 우리나라 경제에서 다른 곳으로 자금을 빼돌릴 뿐이라고 지적한다.
#,AlcoholLaw,주류법,"과도한 알코올 섭취는 건강상의 문제를 초래하고 심지어 사망까지 초래할 수 있다는 증거는 충분하다. 하지만 어떤 사람들은 국가가 개인의 권리에 간섭하는 것을 반대한다. 또한 정부가 술에 새금을 매겨서 많은 돈을 벌 수 있다는 문제도 있다."
#,AlcoholTax,주류세,"의학적으로 정부는 건강에 부정적인 영향과 사회 붕괴의 가능성 떄문에 소비를 억제하기 위하여 세금을 부과하는 분명한 사례가 있다. 반면에 술을 마시는 사람들은 정부가 그러한 세금으로 이익을 얻는 것은 위선적이라고 본다."
#,ArmedPolice,무장경찰,경찰을 무장시키는 것은 범죄를 저지하고 질서를 유지하는데 효과적인 전략이 될 수 있다. 반대론자들은 그것은 범죄자들이 '범죄 군비 경쟁'에서 총기를 사용하도록 장려한다고 주장할 것이다. 비판론자들은 또한 경찰을 무장시키는 것이 법을 준수하는 시민들이 경찰과 거리를 두게 될 것이라고 우려한다.
#,BanSundayShopping,일요일 쇼핑 금지,기독교는 일반적으로 '안식일'을 '휴식의 날'로 인식하고 있으며 많은 종교인들은 이 날 쇼핑을 해서는 안된다고 믿고 있다. 또한 일부 노동조합들은 휴식의 날을 통해 조합원들이 착취당하는 것을 막을 수 있다고 믿고 있다.
#,BiofuelSubsidies,바이오연료 보조금,"Biofuels can reduce oil demand, by mixing ethanol derived from corn with petro-chemical fuel. This is generally popular with environmentalists. Farmers who earn money producing corn for biofuel use also benefit. Biofuels with a higher mix of ethanol can be subsidized through tax breaks."
#,BorderControls,입국 심사,"Without some kind of customs checks at the borders, your country is open to the problem of mass illegal immigration. Some people argue that these immigrants cause crime, others that they take jobs away from your own citizens. Border controls can be effective in reducing illegal immigration."
#,BusLanes,버스전용차선,"Setting aside specific lanes of a road for use only by buses (and perhaps taxis and motorbikes) is one way to get traffic flowing faster and avoid congestion. It also shortens journey times for public transport and therefore encourages usage. There are noticeable costs involved in setting up such schemes, and motorists can be annoyed if the bus lanes seem empty while they remain stuck in traffic."
#,BusSubsidies,버스 보조금,"Traffic congestion and pollution can be reduced by encouraging people to travel by bus instead of car. It can be an expensive option though, and some motorists may resent a transport system they do not use being subsidized."
#,CarbonTax,탄소세,"A carbon tax is a tax levied on all emissions of Carbon Dioxide, thought to be the main cause of climate change. The tax is effectively a pollution tax, and a way to make those individuals and industries who contribute to climate change pay for the damage they cause or to reduce emissions. Obviously the tax is popular with environmentalists, and can also lead to a more energy efficient economy."
#,CarEmmissionsLimits,자동차 배출가스 제한,"Setting legal limits on exhaust fumes helps to reduce air pollution, especially in cities, but it's unpopular with motorists who look upon it as yet more bureaucracy and tax."
#,CarTax,자동차세,"Taxing the ownership of all motor vehicles is one way to persuade people to use alternative forms of transport. It can be argued however, that such a  system increases the fixed costs of car ownership, encouraging people to use a car more once they have gone to the trouble of taxing it. There is also an argument that this is a tax that unfairly hits the poor and people in rural communities where a car is a necessity."
#,CCTVCameras,CCTV 카메라,"CCTV cameras can be a great help in catching criminals and cameras also deter crime.  The installation costs are extremely high, and there are concerns about civil rights from people who don't like to feel that the government is constantly watching them."
#,ChildBenefit,아동수당,"A fixed payment made by the state directly to parents to assist in the cost of bringing up children. Popular with parents for obvious reasons, and the poor who see it as a redistributive tax, but capitalists are opposed to such an unnecessary level of interference by government."
#,ChildcareProvision,보육수당,"By giving state subsidies for childcare, we can ensure more parents return to the workforce after having children, and therefore benefit the economy. Although this can be expensive, and is also a distortion of the market, it is popular with parents."
#,CitizenshipTests,시민권 시험,"Citizenship tests are a way of ensuring that people migrating to our country have a demonstrable understanding of our culture and history. This lessens the chances of a clash of cultures for newcomers to the country, encourages integration and reassures patriotic members of society that they need not fear immigration."
#,CleanEnergySubsidies,친환경에너지 보조금,"Renewable energy might not be ultra efficient yet, but there is an argument for investing heavily in it now so as to strategically prepare our country for a future without fossil fuels. Environmentalists are happy for obvious reasons, but capitalists see it as an unwelcome distortion of the energy market."
#,CleanFuelSubsidy,친환경연료 보조금,"A Subsidy for cleaner fuels such as Ultra-Low Sulfur fuel in an effort to reduce the environmental impact of motoring. The subsidy will reduce the costs of fitting catalytic converters to older cars, and provide an incentive at the  pump to choose less damaging fuels."
#,CommunityPolicing,지역경찰제,"Working with the community rather than attempting to control it. Community policing encourages the police to better understand the needs of the local community, especially in areas with ethnic minorities. Critics see it as an expensive waste of money which could be spent on more direct methods to cut crime."
#,ConsumerRights,소비자 권리,"At a minimum level, the state guarantees that the consumer is not totally ripped off, at the other end of the spectrum, draconian legislation can benefit the consumer at the expense of business. Companies often complain about the amount of legislation governing selling to the public."
#,CorporationTax,법인세,"A direct and proportionate tax on the profits of business. Some argue that this should be the only form of taxation, others that such taxes stifle entrepreneurship and discourage people from starting a business. It is often one of the main ways the government brings in money."
#,Creationism,교육의 세속화,"A bitter battle has raged about the way children are taught science versus religion Scientists and Liberals consider it obvious that evidence based evolution should be taught in science classes. Some religious groups feel that it is wrong to teach evolution or 'Darwinism' as fact, when it remains an unproven theory or that creationism should be taught as an alternative theory in science. The government has to decide what is taught in our schools."
#,Curfews,야간통행금지,"Introduced  for a short period of time in  state of national emergency. These can be an effective way to combat crime at the cost of much personal liberty. Often, however, limiting the ability of peaceful citizens to leave their homes at night can be a sign of a country's degeneration into severe authoritarianism."
#,DeathPenalty,사형제,"The death penalty is the ultimate punishment for serious crimes. Opponents are concerned by the possibility of killing the wrong person, and suggest that only a barbaric state has the death penalty. Supporters point out that it absolutely guarantees no re-offending, and acts as a deterrent to serious crime."
#,DetentionWithoutTrial,재판 없는 구금,"Detention without trial allows your police and security services to detain suspects when they do not have sufficient evidence (or cannot reveal sensitive evidence) to convict suspects. This can be justified in the name of preventing terrorism, but Liberals are concerned that this infringes human-rights."
#,DisabilityBenefit,장애급여,"A direct payment from the state to disabled people to allow for the fact that they are possibly unable, or need assistance to work. Additionally many disabled people have special requirements in terms of transport or housing."
#,FaithSchoolSubsidies,종교학교 보조금,Religious schools can achieve good academic standards. Their supporters make a case  that the government should subsidize methods of education that are proven to be effective. Critics say that religion has no place in education and that the government cannot be seen to 'push' a particular religion on children.
#,ForeignAid,대외원조,"Some foreign countries have very poor economies, poor education or food shortages, and it can be argued that relatively rich nations such as ours have a moral duty to help them. Others may argue that the first priority of any nation is to its own citizens, and if those citizens wish to help, they can do so individually through charities."
#,FreeBusPasses,노년층 무임승차제,"Traditionally, free bus travel is offered as a concession to those citizens of retirement age. This can be expensive, but it's a great way to reduce car usage and thus reduce pollution and congestion. Some oppose such a distortion of the market however."
#,FreeEyeTests,무료 시력검사,"Eye tests catch problems early and advise those with poor eyesight that they need glasses. Getting your eyes tested privately can be expensive, and it's a luxury many people just do without. Socialists believe that the universal provision of free eye tests are essential in providing a health 'safety net' for all."
#,FreeSchoolMeals,무상급식,"Not only are free school meals a way of redistributing wealth by ensuring everyone can afford to feed their children, its also a way to ensure that children eat healthily rather than surviving purely on junk food."
#,Gambling,도박 합법화,"To some, gambling is a sin which leads to poverty and disaster, but others believe that some 'social' gambling is harmless fun which can also be taxed nicely by the government as an additional form of revenue. It also encourages tourism and creates jobs."
#,GatedCommunities,출입통제형 주거단지,"A drastic solution to serious street crime and vandalism, gated communities are basically self-policed residential areas. They are popular with the wealthy, but often associated with class divide and inequality, as only the relatively wealthy can afford to live inside them. As a result, some governments are reluctant to permit their construction."
#,GraduateTax,졸업세,"A graduate tax is a dedicated tax levied purely on people graduating from university, as a way of them contributing to the cost of their university tuition. Supporters say this is fair because not everyone benefits from a university education. Opponents argue that it creates a disincentive to study purely academic subjects and the arts, as well as penalizing ambition."
#,HandgunLaws,총기관리법,"Some countries allow the virtually unrestricted ownership of any kind of firearm, whereas in others it is strictly controlled. Some people talk of the basic right to defend yourself, others are concerned that gun ownership leads to gun crime."
#,HybridCarsInitiative,하이브리드 자동차 지원계획,"Hybrid cars are less damaging to the environment, because at slower speeds they use electric engines that produce no CO2. They also get higher fuel efficiency, thus reducing demand for oil. The downside is they are very expensive, but tax incentives can encourage more people to buy hybrid models when they get new cars."
#,IDCards,신분증,"Some say ID Cards act as a powerful deterrent against terrorism and other serious crimes, but liberals would argue that it is an infringement of an individual's civil liberties for the state to demand that citizens identify themselves on the spot."
#,ImportTarrifs,관세,"Cheap imports can be damaging to the economy because local companies cannot match the lower salaries paid by foreign competitors. Import tariffs help to protect local manufacturers from 'unfair' competition. This does go against real free-market economics though, and can be seen as being unfair to foreign countries, possibly sparking retaliation."
#,IncomeTax,소득세,"One of the most popular ways to raise money for government is a direct tax on peoples earnings, deducted at source by their employer. Income tax is generally a progressive tax (the wealthy pay more as a fraction of their income than the poor) and for this reason it is popular with socialists and the low paid."
#,FlatTax,정률세,"A flat-rate income tax is a tax where every citizen pays the same marginal rate of income tax regardless of their total income. As a result, the cleaner in the office pays the same rate as the CEO, though the CEO's total tax bill will be higher. This simpler structure can lead to lower avoidance and evasion. It is not progressive, and can exacerbate income inequality."
#,CapitalGainsTax,양도소득세,"CGT is a tax levied on non-salary income such as stock market profits and share dividends, and profits from selling property or other assets. Primarily it affects the wealthy and business owners, and will raise more money if the economy is booming. Because it taxes profits from investments, it also acts as a slight deterrent to investment and thus be detrimental to the economy."
#,InheritanceTax,상속세,"A tax paid on the wealth of an individual as it is passed on to their descendants. An inheritance tax protects equality, by preventing families amassing wealth and advantage over the generations, so it is popular with socialists and the poor. However, some people are strongly opposed to anything that prevents them handing on their hard-earned wealth, especially their house, to their children."
#,IntelligenceServices,정보기관,"Security services are an essential tool in the fight against organized crime and terrorism. Good, reliable intelligence can be difficult and expensive to obtain, and in many cases the methods employed can be unpopular with liberals and human rights advocates."
#,InternetCensorship,인터넷 검열,"Liberals would suggest that the internet's greatest characteristic is its freedom from censorship and control, leading to an open and tolerant society. Freedom has its price however, and there is no shortage of material on the internet that can assist those with criminal intent. Opinion on what should and should not be censored on the web is bitterly divided."
#,InternetTax,인터넷세,"As more and more commerce moves from conventional 'bricks and mortar' establishments to the web, governments are tempted to levy taxes on such transactions in order to 'level the playing field'. However, opponents of an internet tax claim that such a move would cripple the hi-tech economy and do enormous harm to the country's competitiveness."
#,JuryTrial,배심원 제도,"The right to be tried by ordinary members of the public rather than a judge is seen as a fundamental human right by many liberals. Conservatives argue that such a process is expensive, time wasting and is no fairer than a judge or a group of magistrates. Its entirely possible to have a system where a jury trial is reserved for more serious offences, with minor trials presided over by a magistrate."
#,LabourLaws,노동법,"Labor laws are basically restrictions on a worker's right to strike. Capitalists argue that such restrictions are vital to prevent key workers such as power station workers, policemen and train drivers from holding the country to ransom. Trade unionists consider the right to strike to be fundamental and not open to negotiation."
#,LegalAid,법률구조제도,"Not everyone has the money to pay a lawyer to defend themselves in court. Although a citizen could theoretically defend himself, providing state-employed lawyers should make for a fairer system. On the other hand, this is basically a big subsidy to people who have already been charged with a crime but remember they are innocent until proved guilty."
#,LegaliseProstitution,성매매 합법화,"Conservatives claim that the legalization of prostitution would mark a severe decline in family values. Others claim that as prostitution is unlikely to disappear, even if illegal, it's better for society and sex-workers that the practice is regulated and monitored rather than criminalized."
#,LuxuryGoodsTax,사치세,"A tax aimed specifically at the high spenders in our society. A surcharge is added to high value luxuries such as sports cars, private yachts etc. Although it is never a vast source of income, a luxury goods tax can be popular with those people concerned with the gap between rich and poor. A luxury goods tax could encourage high earners to live and work elsewhere."
#,MarriedTaxAllowance,기혼자 세액공제,"This is a tax break for married couples, given as an encouragement for people to marry and also to stick together. Church groups see it as essential that the state encourages traditional family values. Some see it as religion meddling in the tax system for no good reason."
#,MaternityLeave,출산휴가,"To some people, ensuring that mothers have a right to maternity leave and to return to their jobs afterwards is a sign of a civilized society, and one that encourages women to work. Some small businesses are concerned that it can put an unpredictable and even potentially crippling burden on an employer, especially where the number of employees is small. It could be argued that this actually encourages employers not to employ women."
#,MicrogenerationGrants,자가전력 보조금,"These grants are given to citizens to help subsidize the cost of energy micro-generation systems such as solar panels and wind turbines. This is a good way to take advantage of some people's desire to make a personal step towards cleaner and greener energy, and will increase the country's overall energy efficiency."
#,MilitarySpending,국방비,"A modern, well equipped military can cost an absolute fortune, and many people feel that the money could best be spent elsewhere. Others (especially patriots) would argue that you cannot put a price on freedom and security, and also point out the huge benefits for our businesses, technology and employment figures."
#,Monorail,고속철도 보조금,"This is not a standard rail network that drags along at mediocre speeds, but a modern high-tech rail system fit for the twenty first century, connecting the country and allowing super-fast travel between major cities. The costs are high, but the benefits for commuters, the economy and the environment are clear."
#,MortgageTaxRelief,주택담보대출 소득공제,"This allows people to claim tax relief on the interest payments they have to make when they borrow money to buy a house. This helps homebuyers to afford their mortgage payments, but can be resented by those who are not in a position to buy a house, as it is effectively a tax break for homebuyers."
#,Narcotics,마약 합법화,"Should drugs such as cannabis and heroin be legalized? Supporters suggest that it is the crime associated with the buying black-market drugs that cause problems, and legalizing narcotics would reduce crime. Opponents point to the health risks and say it would be giving into criminals."
#,NationalService,국민개병제,"Compulsory military service for some citizens where they are taught the basics of how to defend this country from attack has some benefits. For example it would allow us to have a smaller regular army. However, there are concerns about forcing people to bear arms against their will."
#,OrganDonation,장기 기증,"There are few who would disagree that organ transplant is an amazing technology but it requires a plentiful supply of donors. Sadly many people do not give the topic consideration. Some suggest that an 'opt-out' policy is best, with consent for donation assumed unless otherwise stated. Others suggest that this is no place for the state to interfere and explicit permission should be requested."
#,OrganicSubsidy,유기농농업 지원금,"Supporters of organic farming say the state should subsidize this method of farming because of the perceived health benefits of food without artificial flavorings and additives. Naturally this is popular with farmers and environmentalists, but some people see it as a pointless distortion of what should be a free market."
#,PetrolTax,유류세,"Taxing fuel can be a huge source of income for a government, and can also be seen as a 'green' policy by encouraging people to drive less, or to use more fuel efficient cars. Critics suggest that this is just another cynical tax on the motorist, and some complain that the alternative (public transport) is not a viable option for everyone."
#,PhoneTapping,도청,"From a law and order perspective, wire tapping is an essential weapon in the fight against organized crime and terrorism. The problem is that it's difficult to prevent misuse of such a system, and liberals are keen to point out how widespread wire tapping is a very sinister sign of a police state."
#,PlasticBagTax,비닐봉투세,"Plastic bags, unlike paper ones are not biodegradable so can last more or less forever, eventually ending up in huge unsightly landfill sites. A tax on bags discourages their use and encourages people to re-use stronger, more environmentally friendly alternatives. Capitalists just see this as the state meddling."
#,PoliceForce,경찰,"Every government needs to employ a police force to ensure order is kept and laws are obeyed, but it's a matter of debate exactly how much should be spent on the police. Some favor a large force with police on every street corner, other prefer a more low-key and tolerant approach."
#,PollutionControls,공해방지법,"Restrictions on what chemicals and emissions can be released into the atmosphere. Controls reduce pollution and increase health, possibly at the cost of economic competitiveness."
#,PrisonerTagging,전자발찌,"A high tech alternative to incarceration that allows people to re-integrate with the community upon release from prison, whilst allowing law enforcement authorities to keep a close eye on them. Liberals have concerns that such a system is a step towards a police state which monitors our every move."
#,Prisons,교도소,"Some argue that providing the minimum number of bare, cold cells is the only provision that needs to be made for those who have broken the law. Others suggest that spending more money allows for prisoners to be rehabilitated as well as punished and reduces the chances of reoffending."
#,PropertyTax,재산세,"Property tax is a tax levied on the value of homes. The valuation is often made by a government body, and the money is used to fund local government services (at least in part) such as the provision of street lighting and emergency services. Some see it as a fair tax which mostly affects those who own large homes and are wealthy, others see it as an unfair tax on retired people with large homes but little actual income."
#,PublicLibraries,공립 도서관,"Public libraries provide a number of services, acting as a focus for communities, providing access to information and literature to those on low incomes, and enabling people to learn new skills outside the normal educational establishment."
#,RacialProfiling,인종기반 수사기법,"Racial (or ethnic) profiling is the practice of using race as a factor in identifying criminals and potential criminals. Law enforcement officials claim that using racial profiling allows them to quickly narrow down lists of potential suspects, and to best concentrate their efforts but opponents fear that it leads to racial discrimination by the police."
#,RaceDiscriminationAct,인종차별금지법,"Prevents citizens being discriminated against purely on the basis of race, i.e. racist employment practices etc."
#,Recycling,재활용,"Supporters of recycling argue that dumping waste in landfills just isn't a long term solution, and the government needs to show the way by providing facilities to recycle as many waste materials as possible. This might include recycling newspapers, cardboard, bottles and even some plastics."
#,RoadBuilding,도로 건설,"Although environmentalists often argue that more roads just lead to more congestion, not surprisingly this isn't how the motorist who is sat in traffic sees it. Building new roads is a very expensive and very slow process, but some suggest its vital to keep our economy functioning."
#,RuralDevelopmentGrants,농촌개발지원금,"As technology advances and more and more citizens take jobs in our cities, there is a danger that poverty and unemployment will rise to unacceptable levels in the countryside. Rural development grants do distort the free market, but they also support rural businesses and prevent poverty amongst farmers and other rural occupations."
#,SalesTax,부가가치세,"Sales tax is the classic 'regressive' tax, which means it does not take into account the ability to pay. Critics argue that this affects the poor disproportionately and thus increases inequality. Supporters argue that it is relatively easy to collect and affects everyone, and is thus fair. Businesses can be opposed to the administrative burden of the tax."
#,SateliteRoadPricing,위성위치측정식 통행요금체계,An expensive system that requires transponders to be fitted to everyone's car and keeps track of what roads people use (and when). Allows per-road pricing for car usage which gives local authorities fine control over reducing congestion without burdening motorists in more remote rural areas who have no alternative transport system.
#,SchoolBuses,통학버스 보조금,"State subsidies for school buses ensure that every school kid has an efficient, and safe journey to school, whilst reducing the number of short 'school-run' trips carried out by parents, thus reducing traffic on the roads. Parents are also happier knowing that there are proper approved school buses."
#,SchoolPrayers,교내 예배,"Liberals will often argue that the education of our younger citizens should be kept entirely separate from any religious teachings. On the other hand, it's argued that some compulsory prayer in schools is a way of promoting moral values in our children."
#,ScienceFunding,과학기금,"In some countries, the majority of research is funded by private companies. State-sponsored science can be useful for investing in very long-term research projects or those that may not be commercially rewarding. The benefits of state sector research are freely available to the entire population, rather than patented by corporations."
#,SmallBusinessGrants,중소기업 지원금,"The failure rate for small businesses is very high. In the early years of trading, a preferential government grant can be an enormous help to get a new enterprise off the ground. This can lead to a big boost to the economy, but it can also be an expensive policy with no guarantee of good results."
#,SpaceProgram,우주 개발 프로그램,"Invest in your country's efforts to explore space! As well as the purely scientific benefits, a well-funded space program will boost the level of technological expertise throughout the entire economy. It will also unite the country and encourage patriotism."
#,SpeedCameras,과속 카메라,"Speed cameras are an automated way to enforce speed restrictions on our roads, without having to invest a fortune in extra traffic police. Supporters claim they reduce road deaths and free up the police to deal with more serious crime, opponents claim they are a cynical way of taxing the motorist and have nothing to do with safety"
#,StateHealthService,공공의료보험,"Although many citizens would be happy to pay privately for their own health treatment, there is an argument that the state has a duty to provide a minimum level of free health treatment for everyone regardless of income. Health provision can be expensive, so it's a matter of debate as to how much should be spent."
#,StateHousing,공공주택,"Some citizens prefer to own their own homes, but the cost of housing is such that a large proportion of the population live in rented accommodation. State housing is provided, at a reduced rate, to those who cannot afford to pay the market rate. This can be expensive to fund, but the social benefits are also significant."
#,StatePensions,공적연금,"Rather than leave it up to the individual to provide for themselves after retirement, state pensions can guarantee a minimum standard of living for the elderly. Be aware that as life expectancy rises, the cost to the state of paying out pensions increases hugely. The level of state pension may encourage or discourage citizens to save into private pension plans."
#,StateSchools,공립학교,"Free education for all ensures high levels of literacy and can be beneficial to the economy, especially those parts of the economy requiring a skilled workforce. The flipside of this is that state education can be expensive for the government. Capitalists see state education as an unnecessary intervention in the free market."
#,StemCells,줄기세포 연구,"A stem cell is a primitive type of cell that can be developed into most of the types of cells found in the human body. Some scientists claim that stem cell research offers great hope for curing diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. However, because stem cells are taken from discarded human embryos, many 'pro-life' and religious groups oppose their usage."
#,TaxShelters,조세 피난처,"By not fully taxing the wealth of the super-rich, tax shelters can be a great way to encourage successful entrepreneurs to make our country their home. With an ever-shrinking world, the rich are free to settle wherever they please. encouraging them to live here may mean that they spend their wealth in this country. Such measures can be very unpopular with the poor, who resent paying tax on their much lower earnings."
#,TechnologyColleges,기술 대학,"Technology colleges are 'specialist schools' with a focus on computer literacy, biotechnology and similar subjects. These state-run colleges receive special funding from central government in order to encourage a greater level of technological literacy amongst the future workforce."
#,TechnologyGrants,기술 보조금,"The government can provide state funding to encourage business to invest in new and exciting technologies. Although this helps give us a competitive advantage and can create jobs, it can be argued that its an unnecessary distortion of the market."
#,TelecommutingInitiative,재택근무 추진계획,"Telecommuting, or 'working from home' is seen as desirable because it reduces the pressure on the transport infrastructure, and can be an improvement to people's quality of life. It's also welcomed by parents. This policy offers tax incentives to companies supporting this option."
#,TobaccoTax,담배세,"Despite the failure of tobacco companies to admit it, there is good reason to believe that smoking has negative effects on health. This is used as a justification for taxing tobacco. Cynics point out that the government benefits hugely from a tax on a product it is supposedly against. Health campaigners encourage the tax as a way to encourage a more healthy population"
#,TollRoads,유료 도로,"Toll roads charge motorists to use specific roads (normally major highways). This is a great example of directly applying market forces, by only charging those who use a particular route for the construction and maintenance of that route. Motorists tend to see this as just another form of taxation, whereas commuters appreciate not being charged for roads they seldom use."
#,UnemployedBenefit,실업급여,Unemployment benefit is a state benefit given to everyone who is able to work but cannot find employment. Socialists regard this as a minimum safety net for workers out of work because of the whims of the economy. Some believe that high unemployment benefits distort the market and discourage people from seeking work.
#,UniversityGrants,대학 지원금,"Although not all citizens will pursue a university education, governments can provide subsidies to students to encourage a more educated workforce. University grants also ensure equality of opportunity, as in their absence the cost of a university education can be beyond the reach of working class families."
#,WelfareFraudDept,복지 부정수급 조사부,"When government gives so much money out in welfare payments, it's essential that the money is correctly targeted and not exploited by people making spurious claims. A dedicated fraud department will detect false claimants, recover lost money and reassure middle income tax payers that their taxes are being spent wisely, although it can antagonize legitimate claimants."
#,WinterFuelSubsidy,난방비 보조금,A special concession given to the elderly. This is a regular welfare payment made to everyone over retirement age towards the cost of their winter fuel bills. It is designed to reduce 'fuel poverty' which can occur when some elderly members of society cannot afford to heat their homes in winter.
#,WorkSafetyLaw,산업안전법,"Work safety law, often known as 'health and safety' is a series of measures to ensure employees are not at risk from injury in their day-to-day activities. Trade unionists often hail such laws as a valuable defense against unscrupulous employers who may put lives at risk. Many business leaders are concerned at the high levels of bureaucracy and restrictive practices that can result from such laws, which they see as a burden on business."
#,YouthClubSubsidies,청소년센터 보조금,"Free youth clubs ensure that teenagers have a 'place to go' which can help them to stay out of trouble, and in the long run, reduce the incidence of street crime. It can be resented by some wealthier taxpayers, who see it as an unnecessary expense, paid for by their taxes."
#,AbortionLaw,낙태법,"Few areas of policy incite stronger emotions that the debate over abortion. On the 'pro-life' side, are arguments about the rights of the unborn child, and arguments are often made from a  religious standpoint. On the 'pro-choice' side, there is the argument that the State should not have more say over what a woman does with her body than she does. Making any change to the States position on abortion requires a hefty amount of political capital."
#,RentControls,임대료 규제,"An alternative to state-housing is a system where the state will regulate the private-rental market in a bid to ensure the supply of affordable housing for all, even within the private sector. Capitalists will naturally see this as a distortion of the free market that will prevent enough homes being built, whereas supporters will say it prevents exploitation of the poor by greedy landlords."
#,SchoolVouchers,교육 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private schooling, whilst still enabling everyone to afford an education. School  vouchers are issued by the state to parents for each child which they can then spend in the private sector on education. This is a different approach to pure state schooling because with school vouchers the schools are privately run and the teachers are no longer state employees."
#,OilDrillingSubsidy,석유 시추 보조금,"To encourage investment in new oil and gas drilling, and thus raise the supply of fossil fuel energy for the country, these tax breaks effectively subsidize fossil fuels. This will indirectly reduce fuel prices and stimulate the economy, but will be an outrage to environmentalists."
#,MansionTax,고급주택 보유세,"A special high rate of tax charged annually on the ownership of super-expensive homes. This tax is popular with some because it is almost impossible to avoid, as homes cannot be easily hidden. It is perceived as unfair by some elderly people who may have expensive homes but relatively low incomes, and thus have difficulty in paying the annual tax. It is a form of wealth-tax, as opposed to income tax."
#,FuelEfficiency,자동차 연비 규제,"Mandatory standards for new cars which dictate the minimum level of fuel efficiency. This is a long term measure aimed to raise the fuel efficiency of the country's cars, and thus reduce our dependence on oil, as well as reducing the cost of driving over the long term. It will be unpopular with car manufacturers, but a hit with environmentalists."
#,ForeignInvestorTaxBreaks,외국인투자 조세감면,"Special tax breaks given to large foreign-owned multinational companies to encourage them to invest in our country. This could include tax-free periods, introductory rates of corporate tax, and straight subsidies to encourage investment. Helps to encourage investment from overseas, but will be seen as incredibly unpatriotic, and pandering to the whims of huge foreign capitalist organizations."
#,RoboticsResearch,로봇공학 연구지원금,"A special grant to encourage research in robotics. Robotics is a very long term area of research which will eventually bring about vast boosts in productivity, but at the same time it will reduce the amount of low or semi-skilled jobs in the economy, and thus potentially lead to higher unemployment."
#,PrivatePrisons,민영 교도소,"Rather than directly control and manage a State prison service, this policy allows prisons to be privately owned and managed, and merely paid for by the state. Private prisons could result in lower cost and higher efficiency. These measures will be unpopular with trade unionists. Liberals will have ethical concerns about profiting from incarceration, but still be pleased if spending is high enough to promote rehabilitation."
#,JunkFoodTax,정크푸드세,"A punitive tax rate charged on unhealthy food such as takeaway hamburgers, fizzy drinks and high sugar or fat content pre-processed food. Levied with the aim of improving the health of the nation, but can be unpopular."
#,HealthFoodSubsidies,건강식품 보조금,"A tax incentive that makes healthy food, such as fruit and vegetables, cheaper than the higher fat or higher sugar foods. Seen as an incentive to eat well, rather than a punishment for eating badly, and thus less punitive on the poor than a 'fat tax'."
#,Tasers,테이저건,A non-lethal but still highly effective (and possibly dangerous) weapon which effectively gives criminals an electric shock. Supporters say it is a good compromise between the need to disable violent criminals and the risk of death associated with traditional firearms. Opponents claim that the use of such weapons lowers the barrier-to-use for the police and will encourage more casual use of force against the population.
#,PoliceDrones,경찰 드론,"Unmanned aerial reconnaissance vehicles, similar to remote control planes which can be employed by the police force. The 'eye in the sky' is a useful way to keep track of mobs and rioters, and allows for subtle yet effective surveillance. The police see it as a vital tool for modern crime fighting, but there are concerns that this is a step further towards a big-brother style surveillance society where everyone is tracked."
#,ArtsSubsidies,예술 보조금,"Investing public money in the arts is controversial with capitalists who see it as supporting uneconomic elitist entertainment, but others see it as vital to a countries culture, boosting our image on the world stage, and attracting tourists."
#,HealthcareVouchers,의료 바우처,"A measure designed to encourage the growth of private health care whilst still enabling everyone access to it. Healthcare vouchers are  issued by the state to everyone but can then only be spent in the private sector on health care. This is a different approach to pure state health care because with healthcare vouchers, the hospitals are privately run and the medical staff are no longer state employees."
#,HealthTaxCredits,의료비 세액공제,"A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private healthcare, in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts healthcare without involving the state running hospitals or employing doctors, but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place."
#,SchoolTaxCredits,교육비 세액공제,A system of tax-reductions and credits designed to encourage people to spend their money on private education in order to reduce their tax liability. This boosts private schooling without involving the State running schools or employing teachers but it's effect is limited to those people in society earning enough to be paying tax in the first place.
#,FoodStamps,식료품 구매권,"Food stamps is a system where the state will issue vouchers or 'stamps' to those citizens on low or no income, to ensure they are able to afford food. Unlike giving a straight cash benefit, food stamps can only be redeemed for uncooked food, preventing them being used for unhealthy takeaway food. Supporters see food stamps as a valuable way to ensure nobody goes hungry, no matter their income. Critics consider such a scheme patronizing, and no more than papering over the cracks caused by free market failure and low wages."
#,FoodStandards,식품안전국,"A food standards agency is a branch of government dedicated to ensuring the safety and minimum nutritional standards of food supplied within the country. Farmers may regard the agency as an extra layer of bureaucracy and meddling, but public health campaigners see the agency as an essential line of defense between the consumer and unscrupulous food producers looking to cut costs."
#,EnterpriseInvestmentScheme,기업투자제도,"The Enterprise Investment Scheme is a system which gives tax breaks to wealthy individuals who invest their money in small startup companies which are based in this country. The scheme encourages investment in companies which should eventually grow and stimulate the economy, whilst at the same time giving a popular tax break to people who invest in them. Obviously indirectly, the scheme is being subsidized by those without savings to invest."
#,RecreationalDrugsTax,오락성 약물세,"In societies that have legalized drugs such as Cannabis and Psychedelics there is a temptation to treat consumption of these drugs as a source of government revenue, given the claims that their consumption should be politely discouraged due to the negative effects on citizens health, in a similar way to governments taxing alcohol or tobacco."
#,HumanCloningResearchGrants,인간복제 연구지원금,"Stem cell research was just the first step. Human cloning is around the corner and our country can be on the forefront of this groundbreaking development. The religious are enraged, but rich prospective parents hope to make the dream of replicating themselves true."
#,DroneStrikeAct,드론공습법,Global terrorism threatens our country. Drone strikes on foreign grounds are a safe way to prevent terror organisations from reaching their full potential. Patriots are calling for surgical strikes on terror leaders while liberals regard those as unethical.
#,ElectricCarsInitiative,전기차 지원계획,The introduction of a standardized nation-wide recharging system for electric cars has lead to increased sales of such vehicles. Encouraging the acquisition of electric cars reduces our countries dependence on oil. Environmentalists are happy about every car that does not emit carbon dioxide.
#,ClimateChangeAdaptionFund,기후변화적응기금,"Global warming has lead to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. The Climate Change Adaption Fund finances large-scale projects from dams to weather satellites, from reforesting to water reservoirs. It might be expensive, but environmentalists and farmers call for this policy."
#,OneChildPolicy,한 자녀 정책,A one-child policy is a measure of population control to keep overpopulation and related economic and social problems at bay. It reduces poverty and stabilizes the fertility rate. Parents and religious people oppose the law.
#,MarsProgram,화성 프로그램,"Tabloids have been speaking of a new space age for a while. It is time to reach for the stars! Why not start with the neighbor planet Mars? The Mars Program yields new technological innovations, unites the country, and makes patriots proud."
#,AntibioticsBan,항생제 사용금지,"Ranchers and farmers have been feeding antibiotics to livestock since they discovered decades ago that small doses of antibiotics administered daily make most animals gain additional weight. Although conclusive evidence directly linking the use of drugs in food animals to an increase in drug-resistant bacteria has not been uncovered, a number of recent studies suggesting such a link concern many scientists. Banning antibiotics leads to decreased meat production but ensures consumer safety."
#,MandatoryMicrochipImplant,마이크로칩 의무이식,"Passports can be forged and fingerprints can be faked. A microchip under the skin makes every individual in this country technically recognizable. Once implemented, law enforcement will be able to track exactly who went where when. Liberals are enraged about the possibility of absolute surveillance."
#,RareEarthRefinement,희토류 채굴,Support national initiatives for rare earth metal mining in order to make the country's industrial and high tech production less dependent on imports from foreign countries. The extraction process is not good for the environment but our technological advancement depends on rare earth metals. Environmentalists are furious.
#,DriverlessCarLaws,자율주행 법안,Driverless car technology is booming. The manufacturers are encouraging the government to allow their use on public roads.
#,SyntheticMeatResearchGrants,인공배양육 연구지원금,"Overfarming, droughts and population growth result in increases in meat prices. Synthetic production can make meat affordable for the masses. Farmers are opposed, as food production moves from the field to the lab."
#,InternetCurrencyTaxation,암호화폐 과세,"More and more commerce is handled in cryptocurrencies. To cover the cost of tax evasion and tie the new currencies to the fiscal system, rules and taxation are required. An internet currency tax reduces the income of everyone trading in cryptocurrencies, mostly self-employed and small companies."
#,VerticalFarmSubsidies,수직농업 보조금,Farmland is getting rare but recent inventions in architecture and agriculture could easily be bundled to make vertical farming in cities feasible. Food production in vertical farms requires more resources but reduced transport costs mitigate that problem.
#,GreenElectronicsInitiative,친환경 전자제품 정책계획,"The goal of the Green Electronics Initiative is to reduce electronic waste. From cleaner mining operations to upcycling projects, a broad array of measures should make the digital world a cleaner place."
#,InternationalFusionResearchProject,국제 핵융합 연구 프로젝트,"Participate in an international nuclear fusion research and engineering project with the goal of creating a commercially viable fusion power plant.

Environmentalists are traditionally wary of atomic energy."
#,LimitAutomatedTrading,자동매매 제한,"Automated stock market trading software exploits minute movements and short-term patterns in the markets, yielding to higher volatility and instability. Stock market crashes can be prevented by limiting the abilities of automated trading. Capitalists and the wealthy profit most from automated trading."
#,AutomationTax,자동화세,"Technological innovation has led to brilliant inventions. The dark side of industrial automation is that it is leading to job loss. Less jobs mean less income tax. To make up for the loss in state income, the economy ministry has designed an automation tax, to be paid by the most advanced companies."
#,GovernmentSubsidiesForUnions,노동조합 정부보조금,"Trade unions provide a vital service to our nation, and it is in the collective interests of the people that they be encouraged and supported throughout all industries and workplaces. Therefore the government should provide funding, from taxation to support their activities."
#,SecretCourts,비공개 재판,"To combat modern terrorism and crime, it is sometimes necessary to keep things from the public. For that, secret courts are established and controlled by government officials to assure that the law is followed and not broken. We cannot effectively fight terrorism and serious crime if our secret services methods get exposed in open courts."
#,GeneralMediaCensorship,일반매체검열,"There are times when an outraged public is counterproductive to the well-being of a democracy. Enabling  general media censorship can prevent bad rumors and speculation from spiraling out of control and while it limits civil rights, less violence and fear might be worth the effort. We do not wish to give antisocial extremists the free use of our media to create unrest."
#,TortureUsageBySecretServices,정보기관의 고문 허용,"Terrorists are tough customers and to prevent some attacks, extraordinary measures sometimes have to be deployed. While it is never 100% clear how much crime and terrorism can be reduced by such a policy, surely it makes sense to not fight such enemies with one hand tied behind the back of our security services? You have to fight fire with fire."
#,CapCEOPayMultiplier,최고경영자 임금상한제,"Nobody disputes that the job of CEO of a large company is hard, but the current level of pay for executives is out of control and is causing huge anger among the lower paid. A cap on CEO pay is entirely reasonable in a just and fair society."
#,BanSecondHomeOwnership,다주택 보유 금지,"The laws of physics dictate that a person can only be in one place at once. So why would people have the need for two homes? With this policy, owning more than one house is outlawed and empty property will be seized by the government, greatly increasing social equality and giving more people a good home."
#,Banprivateeducation,사교육 금지,"To make sure that school kids learn the right things and are not influenced by strange ideas, banning all private schools may be the  right thing to do. Now that no more so called elite schools exist, every kid has now the same chance to learn and become something great, boosting equality in the process, as children from all classes and income levels mix together."
#,Banprivatehealthcare,민간의료 금지,Why should some people enjoy better or experimental healthcare while others have to toughen it out? Banning private healthcare will make sure that no one gets special treatment while everyone gets what is needed for him or her to get well again. Nobody's health should be determined by the size of their bank balance.
#,Tradeunionbansatcompanies,노동조합 제한,"Companies face a lot of challenges in our modern times. Trade Unions often add to these challenges with their demands and needs, so banning these organizations will help the management focus on making the company competitive and maximize earnings. Of course the workers still have their rights, they just have to earn them without the backing of a wasteful institution."
#,Compulsoryworkfortheunemployed,실업자 강제노동,"Everyone receiving unemployment benefits now has to do some work every week or risk a payment cut in their benefits. This includes public beautification, collecting litter and other tasks that do not risk any jobs. The goal is to make use of this major workforce and get people back into a work routine, hopefully resulting in them getting jobs soon. Nobody should expect to live off the state without working."
#,Punitivewealthtax,징벌적 부유세,"There is nothing wrong with wealth as such, but inequality in our society is bad enough that we must be seen to do something to ensure those with the highest levels of income bear their share of the costs of maintaining a healthy society. It is entirely reasonable to set a tax rate that takes away the majority of income above extremely high levels, as this money is so much more appreciated by those on lower incomes."
#,Publictaxreturns,세금신고서 공개,"Unfortunately some wealthy people in our society try to avoid taxes with illegal tax evasion methods. By  making tax returns public, people can now check if someone is using loopholes or abusing the system. This full disclosure  will encourage support of the system, as well as reducing tax evasion and forcing everyone to be able to justify their income."
#,Compulsorylanguagelessons,외국어강좌 의무수강,"Some people just can't be bothered to learn languages on their own in order to improve their chances on the job market or to understand other people from different nations. Compulsory language lessons will force these people to deal with the world outside, improve our attitudes to foreign visitors, and enable us to better deal with foreign companies, all whilst giving us a greater understanding of other cultures."
#,Banforeignchurchservice,외래종교 예배금지,"Misunderstandings can lead to tragedies and nothing has caused more trouble and deaths in the past than religious conflict. The easiest way to prevent further trouble here is to ban foreign church service outright, avoiding further misunderstandings and unrest."
#,Diversityquotasforcompanies,기업 다양성할당제,"A diverse company is a happy and healthy company. Enabling diversity quotas for companies will force companies hire more people from different ethni backgrounds that have the same qualification, easing racial tensions and making companies a place of equal opportunity."
#,Newcarsubsidies,신차 보조금,"New cars are expensive but also cause less strain on the environment, while old and used cars may be cheaper but also cause more pollution. Using new car subsidies will help people buy new cars that are safer and protect the environment while making motorists happy. New car smell for everyone!"
#,Flagsoneverystreetcorner,국기 의무게양,"To boost patriotism and to induce a sense of belonging into people, putting flags of our country on every street corner will help with our national self esteem. It also looks much better than some burger advertisement."
#,Nationalanthematstartofnews,뉴스 시보 국가 방영,Flashy introductions for news shows may look fancy but it's missing the point: These news are for our people in our country. So we should make that clear and add a flair of patriotism and pride by having the national anthem played at the start of the news instead.
#,Nationalanthemsinschool,학교 국가제창,Young people these days have lost all sense of belonging. Starting the day in school with the national anthem will boost their national pride and help disciplining them. They may not always like it but it's good for them.
#,Compulsorychurchattendance,교회참석 의무화,How can you be saved if you don't listen to what is important and how to live your life? Making church attendance compulsory will save many souls and lead to a better life for the majority of our people. Too bad about those that do not believe in the right thing.
#,Forcepoliticalmilitaryreligiousoath,공무원 및 군인 종교선서 의무화,"Adding religion to oaths given in public by our officials and troops will create a greater sense of honor and security to the public, giving them the feeling that what we are doing is the right thing to do. With righteousness on our side, nothing can go wrong."
#,Publicreligiousbroadcasts,공영종교방송,The voice of faith and reason needs to be heard to have an effect. Adding public religious broadcasts will do a great service in countering all the bad influences of modern mass media as well as making people value the right things again.
#,Bandivorce,이혼 금지,The holy institution of marriage was not meant to be severed by anything other than death. Nowadays people divorce for the silliest things and this threatens whole families and the well being of our children even though often husband and wife just have to toughen through the hard part. Banning divorces will give marriage back it's true meaning.
#,Banhomosexuality,동성애 금지,"According to many religious texts, homosexuality is a sin. In order to combat this, banning homosexuality might convince many sinners to get their life back on track and follow the natural order that God intended."
#,Banlowmpgcars,저효율 자동차 금지,"With gas prices climbing constantly and nature being polluted from all sides, banning cars that use too much fuel may be the right step to protect the environment and help with excessive fuel usage. A big street cruiser might look cool, but it's way too expensive and wasteful and should be banned from the streets. What is good for the enviornment is good for society."
#,Mandatorymicrogeneration,자가전력 의무화,"One of the biggest cost factor in our lives these days is electricity and heat. By making micro generation mandatory, every citizen has the task of generating at least a part of his or her electricity by using solar or wind power, depending on their situation and where they live. A big step towards lowering CO2 Emissions."
#,Punitivetaxonsuperstores,대형마트 징벌과세,"Superstores may be convenient for out citizens, but they have many negative effects, they encourage car journeys, rather than supporting local shops, and their dominance is encouraging a society dominated by big business, with no room for the small family owned store. They should be taxed to reflect the harm they do to the fabric of our society."
#,Limitorbancarsincities,도심지 자동차 통행제한,"Cars are a major factor in air pollution, especially in big cities. Adding a congestion charge or outright banning them from cities will help greatly in fighting air pollution in cities and will increase the use of public transportation. It might look a little extreme to ban cars altogether but it's still better than to breathe in all that poison."
#,Closeairportscompletely,공항 폐쇄,"An extreme measure to fight pollution, closing down all airports will have severe effects on trade, foreign relations and tourism but will cause much less pollution and increase the usage of other transportation. In this modern day, we simply cannot turn a blind eye to the damage to the environment that is being done by our air travel industry. Desperate times call for desperate measures."
#,HealthyEatingCampaign,건강식습관 캠페인,"Through cooking shows, advertisements and specials in newspapers and other media, people are encouraged to be aware of what they eat, what the results of unhealthy food are and how to cook a good meal.

#,CarPoolingCampaign,카풀 캠페인,"It often takes some encouragement for people to come together and make better use of the resources at hand.

And if you still end up in a traffic jam, you at least have people to talk to while waiting."
#,KeepTheCountryTidyCampaign,꺠끗한 나라 만들기 캠페인,"A campaign in popular media, designed to make people feel guilty about littering.

But a guilty conscience will also work when someone is alone, thus making it far more effective in the long run."
#,TourismAdCampaign,관광홍보 캠페인,"Tourism is not only a source of income for many people and businesses, it also strengthens foreign relations.

#,AlcoholAwarenessCampaign,알콜중독 예방 캠페인,"Alcohol can be dangerous, even in moderation. To raise awareness of that, this campaign will show all the trouble that alcohol can get you into, from ruined friendships over accidents and addiction to sickness and death.

#,BusinessStartupCampaign,스타트업 캠페인,"Many people have brilliant ideas, yet only a few of them dare to take the steps necessary to set up their own little business around their idea.

This will help a great deal and make self employed people happy."
#,YouthPoliticsCouncil,청소년의회,"In any democracy it is of utmost importance to teach our kids how politics work and what can be achieved through it.

#,NationalArmedForcesWeek,국군의 날 기념식,"Our heroes and protectors need to be recognized.

#,FreeParentingClasses,무료 육아수업,"Having a newborn child can be very taxing and exhausting for new parents. By introducing these free classes, parents can learn how to deal with this situation, how to raise their babies and have a normal life at the same time.

#,NationalBusinessCouncil,국가경제인협의회,"The establishment of a national business council gives a strong voice to business interests and ensures that the needs of business, both big and small are taken into account.

#,SocialJusticeFoundation,사회정의재단,"This policy will establish a foundation that deals with the worries and problems of the poor and under-represented in our country.

#,SmartMeterProgram,스마트미터 프로그램,"By installing Smart Meters into their homes, people can save money and the environment at the same time, as it will increase the effeciency of energy used.

#,NeedleExchangeProgram,주사침 교환 프로그램,"Drug addition itself is bad enough already, and dirty or infected needles are an additional danger for drug addicts.

#,CompulsoryFoodLabelling,식품표시정보 의무화,"There is plenty of food out there that is not healthy, but companies have found clever ways to obscure that by making it look extra tasty or put the ingredients list in smallest print. This is now over with Compulsory Food Labelling: All foods must now display all the ingredients and additives in it, making it easier for people to choose the food they want to eat while remaining healthy."
#,TradeCouncil,무역위원회,"It has always been a hassle to find trustworthy trading partners in foreign countries.

This will increase international trade and boost the economy."
#,CompulsoryForeignLanguageClasses,외국어 의무교육,"To understand their language is the first important step to understand other people.

This will reduce racial tension while improving foreign trade and relations."
#,LaborDayBankHoliday,노동절 공휴일 지정,"This makes Labor Day an official bank holiday, thus reminding citizens that it is not all about money in our life. While this will certainly help to increase the happiness of the working class and everyone who wants to have a good time, it will have a slight negative impact on the economy because a day wasted is money lost."
#,CityFarms,도시 농업,"Many people would love to buy fresh produce from farmers directly, but living in the city, this is often a hassle to drive out to the countryside. So why not bring some farmers to the cities directly? This program helps ambitious farmers to establish farms in or around cities so they can be close to their customers and it will get some of the city kids to consider a career in farming."
#,EcoHomeRegulations,친환경주택 규제,"By setting rules and standards for houses towards eco-friendliness, there are many more things to be considered now when building houses. This may cause a hassle for developers and landlords, but it will help protect the environment in the long run."

It may take some time to get working effectively, but it will boost foreign relations."
#,WitnessProtectionProgram,증인보호 프로그램,"What good is catching a criminal if the witness to the crime disappears forever?

This will increase the health of our children."
#,BicycleSubsidies,자전거 보조금,"To encourage people to switch from car to bike, a financial motivation is sometimes needed.

And this will result in more people actually using a bike instead of driving a car or staying inside, boosting the health of all citizens by a little."
#,FrequentFlyerTax,항공기 상용고객세,This Tax is charged only for passengers taking multiple flights per year. The idea behind it is to both reduce the amount of air travel (normally for environmental reasons) while still allowing the average-income citizen access to air travel for the occasional holiday.

#,DivertedProfitsTax,우회이익세,"A tax levied on estimates regarding large companies profits earned in this country, regardless of their actual reporting. This is used to prevent multinational companies from claiming that all of the profits they earn are somehow only generated in a tax haven (with little or no corporate taxes), by using cunning accounting trickery. The tax is mostly designed as an incentive to push such companies to play by the spirit as well as the letter of the law."
#,UniversalBasicIncome,보편적 기본소득,"A universal welfare payment given to everyone in society at a flat rate regardless of their income or wealth.

#,MinimumWage,최저임금,"A completely unregulated labor market can lead to wages that trap people in poverty. The government setting a minimum wage addresses this, and reduces inequality, but minimum wages are a market distortion that could push some companies out of business."
#,GayMarriage,동성결혼,"Traditionally, many religions only support marriage between a man and a woman, but more liberal societies are happy to have legally-significant civil partnerships, or even marriages between same sex couples. It's a matter of debate as to whether these should be carried out in churches and by priests."
#,RightToDie,안락사 권리,"Although clearly punishing people for taking their own life is futile, the state often makes it a crime to assist in someone's early death, even if they are in great pain and are unable to carry out the act without help.

#,GenderTransition,성전환,"Some religious groups, and conservative sections of society argue that there are only two genders, and that changing gender should not be allowed.

#,Reforestation,녹화사업,"As a measure to combat CO2, Tree-planting is relatively uncontroversial. However, some campaigners suggest this is treating the symptom, not the cause, and that CO2 should be reduced at source, not captured afterwards."
#,StateBroadcaster,공영방송,"A state-owned broadcaster can provide impartial and independent news without influence from corporate advertising. This can serve as a defense against biased or fake news, but a compulsory 'TV-tax' is not popular with everybody."
#,WorkersOnBoards,노동이사제,"Unpopular with capitalists, who fear that workers will basically vote themselves higher pay and shorter hours. Socialists and trade unionists see this policy as ensuring a company works for its employees as well as its shareholders."
#,TearGas,최루가스,"Tear gas is a great way to control angry crowds, but can have health effects and is seen as a tool of authoritarian regimes. Tear gas is generally only used as a last resort."
#,RubberBullets,고무탄,Rubber or plastic bullets can be fired by police at protesters and rioters as a (usually) non-lethal alternative to actually opening fire with live ammunition. The use of these weapons is generally seen as an extreme measure.
#,WaterCannon,물대포,"An effective, non-lethal and generally low-risk method of crowd control for protesters and rioters. Water cannons are generally seen as a last resort, and more popular with authoritarian governments than democracies."
#,CarbonCaptureAndStorage,탄소 포집 저장,"A variety of engineering solutions to the capturing of Carbon Dioxide emissions to reduce climate change, from direct-air capture, to methods involving capture at source from existing fossil-fuel power stations."
#,PayrollTax,급여세,"A tax levied on employers in proportion to the salaries paid to employees. Easy to collect and hard to avoid, but can act as a disincentive to employment."
#,BorderWall,국경장벽,"The ultimate anti-immigration policy is to build a physical wall around the country to keep illegal immigrants out. This can be ruinously expensive, but it is a bold and visible example of a government's commitment to border defense."
#,QuantitativeEasing,양적완화,"A form of unconventional monetary policy where the central bank effectively prints extra money and uses it to purchases bonds and stocks. This can spur immediate economic activity but will also cause inflation, and increase the wealth of people who own stocks."
#,HelicopterMoney,헬리콥터 머니,"An unusual policy designed to boost the economy immediately, where the government effectively prints free money and hands it directly to citizens for them to spend. Normally the amount is fixed, and can be  withheld from those on high incomes. Like all money printing it is inflationary."
#,CharityTaxRelief,기부금 세액공제,"A policy designed to encourage the wealthy, or anybody who pays tax, to donate to charity, by deducting some of their charitable donations from their income when calculating various taxes."
,,,
#,ExecutiveTermLength,임기,"The length of time that an individual can lead a government for, before a democratic election takes place. Altering the executive term length requires a tremendous amount of political effort. Electing a leader is one of the few events where a nation's people directly exert their influence over the democratic system. It follows that more frequent elections increase the level of democracy in a country."
#,ExecutiveTermLimit,연임 제한,"The number of times that a country's leader can stand for re-election.Term limits act as a method to curb monopolistic governance, where a country's leader becomes officeholder for life. Setting a term limit is a balancing act, as it is an important check to maintain democracy, but can also curtail the benefits of good leadership."
#,JudiciaryIndependence,사법 독립성,"The separation of powers is a model of governance that requires the state to be divided into independent branches of responsibility. The judiciary is made up of a nation's courts of law, which interpret and apply the legislation of a country. Judicial independence is subverted if other branches of government, or private interests, are allowed to exert influence over the courts."
#,PressFreedom,언론의 자유,"The freedom of the press is the freedom of communication and expression through electronic and published media. It is closely linked to freedom of speech, which is the fundamental human right to communicate opinions and ideas uncensored. Curtailing press freedom negatively impacts democracy, but affords the censor control over access to information."
#,ForeignInvestmentRestrictions,외국인 투자제한 제도,"With foreign investment comes foreign influence. Where such influence is seen to be unwelcome, restrictions can be put in place to stem foreign investment. This curtailment of a global free market is generally unpopular with capitalists, but supported by patriots, who are against any foreign influence exerted on their nation."
#,GameHunting,사냥 제한,"Hunting animals for sport is a contentious pursuit, especially if their numbers in the wild are dwindling. However, wild animals can be considered to be part of a country's natural resources, able to be exploited to create a valuable hunting industry. Regulating game hunting is a way of managing animal populations, protecting other species, and ensuring hunters pay for their privileges. Of course, nature may be best served by an outright ban."
#,AntiCorruptionAgency,반부패기구,"Establishes an anti-corruption enforcement agency. Eliminating corruption may be mandated, but detecting perpetrators and prosecuting them is the only way to stamp out the abuse of power for personal gain. The more resources an anti-corruption agency has, the more powerful the offenders that they can bring to justice."
#,FemaleGenitalMutilationBan,할례 금지,"Genital mutilation is a  ritual inflicted on children (both male and female), and perpetuated by an inherited social and religious acceptance of the practice. Make it clear to all citizens that this violence towards children is no longer acceptable with an outright ban. By allocating resources to this ban's enforcement, its impact will be deeper and more rapidly felt."
#,IntellectualPropertyRights,지적재산권,"Establish the protection of innovative ideas by granting their creators a period of monopoly over their use. Advocates of intellectual property rights claim that invention is incentivized by allowing the owners of ideas to benefit financially. The aim is to promote creativity and progress. However, in practice the use of these rights tends to favor the resource rich, who can pay for rights registration and enforcement."
#,GenderDiscriminationAct,성차별금지법,"Make discrimination against women illegal. As well as equal rights for women being written into law, the step can be taken to correct historic inequality with positive action. Affirmative action favors the employment, or appointment, of women for roles across the full spectrum of the labor market and political system. "
#,FamilyPlanning,가족 계획,"Implement a program of family planning to improve sexual health in your country. Typical services include education, medical advice, and contraception distribution.

#,TobaccoAwarenessCampaign,금연 캠페인,"Governments have long known the terrible harm that smoking does to its citizens health, but getting them to kick the habit is harder than it sounds. A tradeoff has to be made between reducing the impact on the nations health services versus any tax revenue that smoking brings in."
#,CapitalControls,자본이동 통제,"Restrictions on the flow of capital out of the country. This is a fairly extreme measure to prevent wealth flowing out of a country. Citizens are prevented from taking more than some fixed amount of currency out of the country, in order to prevent capital flight, where the wealthy leave and take their wealth with them. This is very unpopular with the wealthy, and capitalists who see it as a restriction on their freedom of movement and their property rights."
#,BodyCameras,바디캠,"The compulsory wearing of cameras by law enforcement workers is a way to ensure that those workers stick to the law themselves and act in a respectful and honorable way when engaging with members of the public. Without cameras, corruption and bullying complaints against police are not so easily dealt with."
#,SocialCare,사회적 돌봄,"A package of policies which provide care directly to those who need it, from the state. This includes day-care and residential care-home for the elderly who can no longer live alone, care for dementia and support for women's refuges, and for people with mental health difficulties."
#,CongestionCharging,혼잡통행료,"In many large cities, the number of cars travelling in each day is simply unsustainable. Although a fairly blunt instrument, simply charging (through number plate recognition) every vehicle that enters a city each day has proven to be an effective way to reduce congestion in extreme cases."
#,PrisonerVoting,재소자 선거권,"In some countries, all prisoners retain the right to take part in elections, in order to encourage a feeling of still being a part of society and to ensure their welfare is represented. In others, the right to vote is seen as a privilege granted to those who abide by society's rules, and rightfully removed from those who are incarcerated."
#,SelectiveSchooling,비평준화 학교,"The government has to take a view on whether it is best that all students be educated together in the same classroom, regardless of ability, or if it is desirable to place the most talented students in their own classes (which teach faster) or maybe even have dedicated schools for those of the highest ability."
#,Cyberbullyingawarenesscampaign,사이버폭력 인식캠페인,"A program of adverts on TV, radio, online and billboards to warn parents and teachers to look out for signs their children are being bullied online, so that the problem can be spotted early and dealt with before it affects children's mental health."
#,DrugEnforcement,마약단속국,"A specialist team of police experts trained to deal with the very specific demands of enforcing our nations restrictions on narcotics. Trained sniffer dogs, undercover agents and border-police all work together to stop the flow of drugs into our country."
#,DrugTreatment,마약중독 치료계획,"Punishing people for taking illegal drugs only goes so far. What people really need is treatment, and a long term plan to get people off their dependence on narcotics. These schemes aim to fight the drug issue by reducing demand, instead of limiting supply."
#,StateAirline,항공공사,"So much prestige is wrapped up in a national airline, that literally flies the flag for our country, that its often considered worthwhile to have a state-owned and run airline, maybe run at a loss to encourage tourism, and patriotism."
#,StatePostService,우체국공사,"A state-owned and run postal service can make sense because it is a natural monopoly, and one where a universal service obligation (deliveries to all addresses for the same cost) is generally preferred. The postal service is also a large creator of employment."
#,NuclearFission,원자력 발전소,"Nuclear fission is arguably a renewable source of energy, which dramatically reduces CO2 emissions and reduces oil & gas demand, but can be expensive to produce and comes with problems concerning waste and decommissioning. Environmentalists tend to prefer wind and solar energy instead."
,,,
#,SolidarityTax,연대세,"A top-up to Income Tax that is particular to Germany and which was introduced to help cover the costs associated with the reunification of East and West Germany, and the the need to upgrade infrastructure throughout east Germany."
#,BanCoal,석탄 금지,"In the fight against Climate Change, it is worth remembering that coal is one of the worst possible contributors, and it makes sense that now we have the technology to switch to using renewable energy (or even oil & gas) for our needs, that we pass a law to stop the remaining use of this highly polluting energy source."
#,FinancialTransactionsTax,금융거래세,"Investment is all well and good, but frankly a great deal of the financial transactions in our economy are needless speculating and effectively gambling, which rakes in huge profits for hedge funds and financial firms but creates nothing of value. A small tax on each transaction should raise money AND reduce dangerous speculation."
#,ProportionalFines,재산비례벌금제,"A fine is no deterrent to anti-social behavior at all if it does not scale with income. What may be a colossal and finances-wrecking penalty for some is a mere inconvenience for the ultra-wealthy. By making all fines scale with income, the law can finally be applied equally to all. Is that fair?"
,,,
#,RetirementAge,정년제도,"Where state pensions exist, this policy sets the minimum age at which workers can retire and receive a pension from the state. This is also used as a general benchmark by private businesses when setting their own retirement ages. An early retirement may be desirable for workers, but it impacts the economy and will reduce productivity."
#,CitizenshipForSale,시민권 판매,"Where immigration causes concern about an influx of low paid workers, or those who may be dependent on the state or otherwise represent a  drag on resources, citizenship may be granted to those immigrants who have considerable personal wealth, and thus can prove they will not be a burden. This may appear to be unfair to the majority of would be immigrants without such means."
#,ImmigrationRules,이민법,"Rules on who is, and who is not permitted to migrate to the country. The official rules will have little impact on illegal migration, but nevertheless can have a big impact. Some believe immigration will boost the economy, but those on low pay are often concerned about the competition for jobs."
#,RefugeePolicy,난민 정책,"Most countries accept that they have a moral responsibility to take in migrants from disaster zones or war-torn countries, but there is strong debate on how loose these restrictions and limits should be, especially if climate change and other factors lead to a large rise in global refugees."
,,,
#,banwomendriving,여성운전 금지,"Whether the justification is some passage in a religious text, or just a general cultural attitude that implies women can not or should not control a motor vehicle, this policy represents restrictions on 50% of the population in terms of their freedom to drive. This may be popular with extreme conservative and religious groups but is the extreme opposite of liberalism and gender equality."
#,religioustax,교회세,"Effectively an income tax, or tithe that hands a percentage of peoples earnings directly to religious institutions, for use as they see fit. Hopefully this funnels money into good causes in the same way as charities do, but there is ample room for corruption as unlike the state, religious leaders are not elected by those paying this tax."
#,religiousbanknotes,종교요소 화폐도안,"This policy allows for the use of religious phrasing, or iconography on banknotes and coins. A powerful way to remind citizens that religion is a big part of their lives, and is effectively part of the state. This can cause offense among those who demand separation of church and state."
#,statereligion,국교,"A country can select a specific religion as the official religion for the state, even if it still permits atheism and the worship of other religions. At the least this involves some ceremony, but it can also extend to giving actual political power to unelected church representatives, and involving the church in procedures such as swearing in new elected representatives."
,,,
#,desalination,담수화 시설,"Desalination plants are a way to make water suitable for human consumption using seawater as an input. Although expensive and energy intensive, it is a solution to a water shortage where other methods to prevent the shortage have failed or are insufficient or unpopular."
#,watermeters,수도계량기 의무설치,"The installation of water meters for every household, and the subsequent charging for water based on consumption is one very effective method for reducing water usage and preventing a water shortage, although it can be a long slow process to install meters for every house in the country."
#,plasticstax,플라스틱세,Plastic waste is a major concern among environmentalists due to the very long time that waste plastic can remain in our ecosystem. A tax on plastic production ensures that environmentally friendly alternatives are chosen instead when suitable.
#,packagingtax,포장세,"Even with recycling, the use of excess packaging can be an environmental disaster. One solution is taxing the production or use of packaging materials. This gives business an incentive to work on more efficient designs for their product packaging."
#,unexplainedwealth,재산출처 공개명령제,"A break with the normal assumption of innocence until proven guilty, unexplained wealth orders allow prosecution where a wealthy individual cannot explain where their wealth comes from. Controversial, but an effective policy against career criminals who are clearly profiting from crime, but have covered their tracks well."
#,competitionlaw,독점규제법,"Competition law is basically a trade-off between protecting the ideals of the free market, protecting the consumer from monopolies and encouraging competition on one side, and allowing businesses to grow and for the best companies to succeed on the other."
#,bordernavy,해안방위대,"Border walls cannot work in an ocean, so the equivalent means of deterring illegal immigration for islands and nations with extensive coastline is to invest in patrol boats that intercept and send back any ships carrying illegal immigrants."
#,NuclearWeapons,핵무기,"Nuclear Weapons are the ultimate deterrent against serious military action against a nation. Although there is no reliable defense against nuclear attack, the threat of a retaliatory strike is enough to deter aggression from nation states. To be absolutely sure of a reliable second strike capability, nations that can afford them will opt for nuclear-armed submarines on constant patrol, undetectable by enemy forces, or in theory, space-launched weapons."
